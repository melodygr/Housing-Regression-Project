### Business Problem    
King County Real Estate is a luxury real estate company serving sellers and buyers in the high income earning areas of King County, Seattle. The company wants to understand which features translate to higher housing prices in these areas, as well as develop a model to predict price based on housing features.

### Data    
This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in kc_house_data.csv in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in column_names.md in the same folder. In an effort to narrow the scope of the data to suit our business problem, we also obtained census data of individual income tax returns by zip code for the state of Washington.  An editted version of this data can be found in agi_zip_code.xlsx in the data folder in this repo.  The cleaning and selection of relevent data from this dataset can be seen in the [Additional_Data](https://github.com/swzoeller/Housing-Regression-Project/blob/main/Additional_Data.ipynb "Additional Data Notebook") notebook in the repo.

### Modeling Process
Following the OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret) data science framework, we began with an understanding of our business problem and the acquisition of data.

### Conclusions  
The movie industry appears to still be growing every year, both in budgets and revenue.  While there are many players in the industry, a top few, including Walt Disney Studios, appear to be the ones to watch.  Movie-goers prefer movies in the Action, Adventure, and Fantasy genres, although these are not the most produced movies.  In that vein, the highest grossing moving ratings are PG, G and PG-13, yet these also are not the most produced movies.  Microsoft should consider producing movies based on what market research indicates that movie-goers actually want to watch.

### Next Steps / Future Work  
To truly be able to know if the industry is growing, we would want to account for inflation over the years.  Also, measuring profit instead of gross box office sales would ensure us that movies are not costing so much more to make now that it is overshadowing the increase in revenue. Further research into each studio is recommended as well as an analysis of the studios' performance over time.  Gross revenue and profitablity of popular genres and movie ratings should be examined with current data.  We should also consider analyzing if movie genre or rating popularity has been changing over time.
